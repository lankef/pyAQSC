The files contain the functions evaluated in a discrete phi grid for some anisotropic pressure constructions. The input.dat file contains the input parameters [nfp sigma_0 eta B20c B22c B22s B31c B31s B33c B33s Ba0 Ba1] in that order. The axes for the different folders are:

The notation represents [number of harmonics, 0 harm, value, nth harmonics, value_cos,value_sin,...].

The higher B_thetas are set to zero.
